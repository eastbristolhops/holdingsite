            <p class="oldcrewstory">
                East Bristol Hops are always looking for new members.

                Our goal is to become self-sufficient by propagating enough hop plants such that everyone interested in
                joining the association can just be given one.
            </p>
            <p class="oldcrewstory">
                Until then, though, we will be placing an order for rhizomes early in the new year.

                If you'd like to join in next year's harvest, please leave your details via the
                <a class="linksButtons" href="contact.html">Contact form</a> so we can get in touch with you
                nearer the time regarding how to order and how much your plant will cost. As an example, in previous
                years we have
                charged £18 per plant,<br> which includes not only the hop itself but also almost everything else you'll
                need to
                get set up.<br>

                If you'd like to get involved, but don't have any spare cash, do please still get in touch as we have a
                limited number of plants propagated by our growers which we could donate for free.<br>

            <h1 class="oldcrewheading">Where it all began</h1>
            <p class="oldcrewstory">
                East Bristol Hops was formed in 2016 by four friends who had the idea to bring together a
                community of hop growers in Bristol who collectively would provide green hops to a local brewery for a
                uniquely Bristolian brew.<br>
                Within a few weeks of first talking about the idea and approaching a few breweries in the bristol area, 
                the team managed to get (Dawkins Ales) on board and an
                enthusiastic community of growers soon followed. That September 7kg of fresh, green hops were harvested and were used
                to make the first edition
                of a beer dubbed Easton Promise, which we launched during Cask Ale Week.

            <p class="oldcrewstory">
                The association has gone from strength to strength since that first year as plants get more established,
                the number of contributors increases
                and the amount of harvested hops goes up. In our second year, the harvest was over 20 kilos - a
                significant milestone as it meant the
                2017 beer contained only locally grown cones.
                Bringing together people with a passion for beer, small breweries and their community has been the chief
                goal of the association since its inception. <br> If you'd like to get involved,

                What's this Beer then?
            </h2>
            <p class="abouthebrew">
                The Beer is called Easton Promise – a name that was chosen in a competition held amongst our first wave
                of growers, who now number well over a hundred and are spread all over the Bristol area.
            </p>

            <p class="brewrecipe">
                The recipe is somewhat of a secret, as it changes year on year, but we <strong>Promise</strong> you it's good!
            </p>
            <p class="brewrecipe">
                What we can tell you, is that Dawkins Ales expertly craft our hops into this fantastic beer, which is
                packed full of locally-grown wet Bullion, Fuggles, Primadonna (UK) hops, Cascade and the odd bit of Bramling Cross.
                <br>
                Its super-fresh, grassy, hoppy flavours are only possible because the hops are picked straight off the
                Bine, capturing all the delicate volatile aromas from the natural hop oils.
                <br>
                What's the ABV? <br>
                Well, this is a concept beer so we'll let you know when we know!
